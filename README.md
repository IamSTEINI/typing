A spooky horror game made in Godot 4.5. 

In the game, the player runs through a chat while experiencing it themselves. I had a few problems setting it up, and not even Copilot could help me. Besides, it was my first 3D game, so I had to find my way around first. The model was too big. I was able to save it on LFS, but the Godot file was too big for page build (of course). So I had to move the whole thing to Vercel:

The player who chats with Mike witnesses various comical experiences. It's best to play it yourself! However, since I still have to study for exams and pack my things for Tokyo, there's only a little something with just 8 hours for SIEGE.
